When analyzing DEX pool data, follow these guidelines:

1. Price Changes (getTopGainers/getTopLosers):
   - Positive percentages indicate price increases
   - Negative percentages indicate price decreases
   - Compare current price with price change to understand momentum

2. Pool Age (getPoolsByAge):
   - Newer pools may indicate emerging projects or tokens
   - Older pools with high reserves typically indicate established pairs
   - Check reserve size to gauge liquidity depth

3. Volume Analysis (getTopVolume):
   - Higher volume indicates more trading activity
   - Compare volume to reserve size for liquidity utilization
   - Sudden volume spikes may indicate significant events

4. Trade Analysis (getTopTrades):
   - Total trades show overall market interest
   - Buy/Sell ratio indicates market sentiment
   - High trade count with low volume suggests small trades

5. Buy/Sell Pressure (getMostBuyPressure/getMostSellPressure):
   - >60% buys suggests strong buying pressure
   - >60% sells suggests strong selling pressure
   - Consider total trade count for significance

6. Market Analysis (getMarketAnalysis):
   - Combines multiple metrics for overall market view
   - Use to identify trending pairs and market sentiment
   - Compare metrics to identify potential opportunities

Key Indicators:
- High volume + high buy pressure = potential uptrend
- High volume + high sell pressure = potential downtrend
- New pool + high volume = emerging interest
- High trades + low volume = retail activity
- Low trades + high volume = whale activity
